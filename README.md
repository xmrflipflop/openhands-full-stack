Agent Canvas is a web frontend for managing agents. You can:

- ⌨️ prompt them manually
- 🕐 run them on a schedule
- ⚡ trigger them automatically—e.g. from Slack or GitHub.

Agents can run anywhere:

- 🧑‍💻 on your laptop
- 🖥️ on a remote virtual machine
- ☁️ in our hosted cloud
- 🏢 or inside your company’s infrastructure

You can work with any agent (e.g. Claude Code, Codex) or connect directly to an LLM (e.g. Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Minimax, Kimi).

If you have questions or feedback, please open a GitHub issue or join the [#proj-agent-canvas channel in Slack](https://openhands.dev/joinslack)

## Quickstart

### With Docker (recommended)

**Prerequisites**:

- Node.js 22.12.x or later
- `npm`
- Docker

Set `$PROJECTS_PATH` to the directory on your machine where your projects live (e.g. `/path/to/your/projects`). The agent server will mount this directory so the agent can read and edit your code.

By default the container runs as your host UID/GID so files written to bind mounts remain writable from your host account. The container is still kept isolated from your host home: its `/home/openhands` is a temporary writable home, and only `~/.openhands`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, and `~/.ssh` are mounted individually under it (and only if they exist). If you want the **Add Workspace** dialog to browse your real host filesystem, set `OH_MOUNT_HOST_HOME=1` before `npm run dev:docker` to bind-mount your entire host home onto `/home/openhands` in the container. The Add Workspace modal also shows this hint inline when it detects the mount is off. Watch the video on how to run this on [Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BenkkQmmFCg) or [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAxf_RRIrB8).

```sh
export PROJECTS_PATH=/path/to/your/projects
git clone https://github.com/OpenHands/agent-canvas.git
cd agent-canvas
npm install
npm run dev:docker
```

This serves a static production build of the frontend behind the local ingress proxy. That is the recommended mode for normal use, remote access, and tunnels such as ngrok because it avoids Vite hot-reload restarts and large dev-module request bursts. If you are developing the Agent Canvas frontend itself and want live reload, use `npm run dev:docker:dynamic` instead.

Windows PowerShell exception: if `npm run dev:docker` starts the backend but `localhost:8000` shows Bad Gateway, start the same stack directly with Node instead. Replace the path below with your projects folder, and do not include any prompt characters or a trailing `>` in the value.

```powershell
$env:PROJECTS_PATH = "/path/to/your/projects"
git clone https://github.com/OpenHands/agent-canvas.git
cd agent-canvas
npm install
node --env-file-if-exists=.env .\scripts\dev-docker.mjs
```

Access the UI at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The OpenAPI docs for the agent server and the automation backend are also served through the ingress proxy at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) and [http://localhost:8000/api/automation/docs](http://localhost:8000/api/automation/docs).

### Without Docker

> [!WARNING]
> This runs the agent-server directly on the machine you're installing on--the agent will have full access to your filesystem!

Running without docker is great if you're running Agent Canvas on a VM. See [SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md) for details,
especially with respect to security hardening. Notably, you can run the backend on _multiple different VMs_ and switch between
them from the same Agent Canvas frontend!

**Prerequisites**:

- Node.js 22.12.x or later
- `npm`
- `uv` (for running the agent server via `uvx`)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenHands/agent-canvas.git
cd agent-canvas
npm install
npm run dev:dangerously-dockerless
```

Access the UI at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The OpenAPI docs for the agent server and the automation backend are also served through the ingress proxy at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) and [http://localhost:8000/api/automation/docs](http://localhost:8000/api/automation/docs).

This also serves a static production build for stability. If you are developing the Agent Canvas frontend itself and want live reload, use the dynamic dockerless command instead:

```sh
npm run dev:dangerously-dockerless:dynamic
```

# Architecture

Agent Canvas is powered by the [OpenHands Agent Server](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/tree/main/openhands-agent-server/openhands/agent_server), a REST API for running multiple agents on a single machine. Each Agent Server runs on a single host/port; the Agent Canvas can connect to multiple Agent Servers and easily flip between them.

You can run an Agent Server anywhere:

- Directly on your laptop (be careful!)
- Inside a Docker container
- On a dedicated machine like a Mac Mini
- On a virtual machine in the cloud
- Inside a Kubernetes Pod
- Inside OpenHands Cloud (our commercial offering)

The Agent Server is often paired with an [Automation Server](https://github.com/OpenHands/automation), which lets you set up agents that run on a schedule or in response to events.

## npm Package

Agent Canvas is also available as an npm package for embedding in your own applications:

> [!WARNING]
> Agent Canvas has not published a stable release yet. Until the first stable version is available, the npm `latest` dist-tag may point to alpha, beta, or release-candidate builds, so `npm install @openhands/agent-canvas` can install a prerelease. Pin an exact version if you need predictable behavior.
> This temporary behavior is tracked in [#395](https://github.com/OpenHands/agent-canvas/issues/395); retag `latest` to the first stable release when it ships.

```bash
npm install @openhands/agent-canvas
```
