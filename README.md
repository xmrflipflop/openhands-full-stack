OpenHands is a platform for managing agents across a variety of environments. You can:

- ⌨️ prompt agents manually
- 🕐 run agents on a schedule
- ⚡ trigger agents automatically — e.g. from Slack, GitHub, or Datadog.

Agents can run anywhere:

- 🧑‍💻 on your laptop
- 🖥️ on a remote virtual machine
- ☁️ in our hosted cloud
- 🏢 or inside your company’s infrastructure

You can work with any agent (e.g. Claude Code, Codex) or connect directly to an LLM (e.g. Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Minimax, Kimi).

If you have questions or feedback, please open a GitHub issue or join the [#proj-agent-canvas channel in Slack](https://openhands.dev/joinslack)

## Quickstart

### Direct Install

> [!WARNING]
> This runs the agent-server directly on the machine you're installing on--the agent will have full access to your filesystem!
>
> We recommend running on a dedicated machine, such as a VM in DigitalOcean or a dedicated Mac Mini.
> See [SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md) for details, especially with respect to security hardening.

The most powerful way to run OpenHands is on a server in the cloud. This allows your agents to continue running
even when your laptop is shut, and makes it easier to trigger your agents through third-party services
like Slack, GitHub, and Datadog.

Notably, you can run the OpenHands Agent Server backend on _multiple different VMs_ and switch between
them from the same Agent Canvas frontend!

**Prerequisites**:

- Node.js 22.12.x or later
- `npm`
- `uv` (for running the agent server via `uvx`)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenHands/agent-canvas.git
cd agent-canvas
npm install
npm run dev:dangerously-dockerless
```

Access the UI at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### With Docker Sandbox

If you're running on your laptop, you likely want to sandbox OpenHands to limit the agent's access to your system.

Watch the video on how to run this on [Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BenkkQmmFCg) or [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAxf_RRIrB8).

**Prerequisites**:

- Node.js 22.12.x or later
- `npm`
- Docker

Set `$PROJECTS_PATH` to the directory on your machine where your projects live (e.g. `/path/to/your/projects`). The agent server will mount this directory so the agent can read and edit your code.

```sh
export PROJECTS_PATH=/path/to/your/projects
git clone https://github.com/OpenHands/agent-canvas.git
cd agent-canvas
npm install
npm run dev:docker
```

Access the UI at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

# Architecture

Agent Canvas is powered by the [OpenHands Agent Server](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/tree/main/openhands-agent-server/openhands/agent_server), a REST API for running multiple agents on a single machine. Each Agent Server runs on a single host/port; the Agent Canvas can connect to multiple Agent Servers and easily flip between them.

You can run an Agent Server anywhere:

- Directly on your laptop (be careful!)
- Inside a Docker container
- On a dedicated machine like a Mac Mini
- On a virtual machine in the cloud
- Inside a Kubernetes Pod
- Inside OpenHands Cloud (our commercial offering)

The Agent Server is often paired with an [Automation Server](https://github.com/OpenHands/automation), which lets you set up agents that run on a schedule or in response to events.
