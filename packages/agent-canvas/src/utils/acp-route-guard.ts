/**
 * Issue a ``redirect`` to ``/settings/agents`` when the personal settings
 * say the active agent is ACP.
 *
 * The ACP sub-agent owns its own LLM and condenser, so the canvas-side
 * surfaces that configure those concepts (``/settings``,
 * ``/settings/condenser``) have nothing useful to do while ACP is active.
 * (``/mcp`` is intentionally *not* guarded: ``mcp_config`` is forwarded
 * to the ACP subprocess at session creation.) Doing the redirect in a
 * ``clientLoader`` (instead of a per-route ``useEffect``) prevents the
 * one-frame flash of the old content before the guard fires.
 *
 * ``staleTime: 0`` is intentional: the read drives a redirect, and a
 * 5-minute stale tolerance would let a cross-tab agent-kind flip route
 * the user to the wrong page until the cache caught up. PATCH /settings
 * already invalidates this key, so the forced refetch only fires when
 * something might actually have changed.
 *
 * Fall through silently on settings-fetch errors (unauthed, network,
 * local agent-server not running) — better to render the page than
 * redirect-loop on a missing payload.
 *
 * Cache key is aligned with {@link useSettings} so the loader and the
 * in-render hook share a single cache entry rather than thrashing the
 * same data through two different keys.
