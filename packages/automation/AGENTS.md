# Automations Service

Self-contained microservice that schedules and dispatches automation runs inside OpenHands Cloud sandboxes.

## Cross-Repository Boundaries

This repository owns the Automation Service: automation definitions, cron scheduling, webhooks, run history, dispatch, and sandbox lifecycle orchestration. It manages when work runs and dispatches conversations to the Agent Server/SDK, which owns agent/tool behavior, conversations, workspaces, events, and API endpoints.

Related repositories have different responsibilities:

- [`OpenHands/software-agent-sdk`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk) owns the Python SDK, Agent Server, canonical API, and execution behavior.
- [`OpenHands/typescript-client`](https://github.com/OpenHands/typescript-client) owns the browser-compatible typed client for the Agent Server API.
- [`OpenHands/OpenHands`](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands) owns Agent Canvas UI, frontend integration, and local-stack orchestration.
- [`OpenHands/extensions`](https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions) owns reusable skills, plugins, automations, and integrations.

If a PR is opened in the wrong repository, explicitly recommend closing and moving it to the repository that owns the change rather than merging it here. PRs must follow the repository's contribution and applicable code-review guidance.

## Cross-Repo Coordination

Three repos work together:

| Repo | Branch | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `OpenHands/automation` | `dispatch-phase1b` | Automation service (this repo) |
| `OpenHands/deploy` (aka `All-Hands-AI/deploy`) | `dispatch-phase1b` | Deploys automation as a sidecar |
| `OpenHands/software-agent-sdk` | `feat/saas-runtime-mode` | SDK changes for in-sandbox execution |

**AUTOMATION_SHA linking**: The deploy repo references a specific automation commit in two workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` → `AUTOMATION_SHA: "<full-sha>"`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-automation.yaml` → `AUTOMATION_SHA: "<full-sha>"`

After pushing to the automation repo, update both files in the deploy repo.

## Configuration

Configuration is centralized in `config.py` using a composed `AppConfig` with typed sections:

```python
from automation.config import get_config

config = get_config()
config.service.db_host          # ServiceSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.storage.file_store       # StorageSettings (no prefix, SDK conventions)
config.http.auth_cache_ttl      # HttpSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.sandbox.max_run_duration # SandboxSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.kv.kv_secret             # KVSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.git_sync.git_sync_repo_url # GitSyncSettings (AUTOMATION_ prefix)
config.log.log_level            # LogSettings (no prefix)
```

**Key principles:**
- Use `get_config().<section>` instead of deprecated `get_settings()`
- All environment variables documented in config class docstrings
- Protocol constants (WORK_DIR, TARBALL_PATH) in `constants.py` - these cannot be changed without breaking compatibility
- Shared logging context via `log_extra()` from `automation.utils`

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Pre-commit (run from repo root)
pre-commit run --files openhands/**/*.py scripts/**/*.py tests/**/*.py --show-diff-on-failure

# Unit tests (no external deps, skips Docker-dependent tests)
uv run pytest tests/ -v --ignore=tests/integration

# Integration test (requires OPENHANDS_API_KEY)
OPENHANDS_API_KEY=sk-oh-... uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v

# E2E test script (live sandbox, ~80s)
OPENHANDS_API_KEY=sk-oh-... uv run python scripts/test_automation.py --api-url https://staging.all-hands.dev
```

## Product Telemetry Identity

- Cloud product events use the server-authoritative Cloud user ID as the PostHog `distinct_id`; never trust a client telemetry header as Cloud identity.
- Local Agent Canvas requests carry their consented PostHog identity in `X-OpenHands-Telemetry-Distinct-Id`. Store that value on newly created automations and runs so asynchronous lifecycle events retain the same identity.
- Local events with no Canvas attribution fall back to the DB-backed automation backend ID. Keep `automation_backend_id` as an event property for installation analysis rather than substituting it for a known person identity.
- Local consent is stored per frontend distinct ID. Attributed events require consent for their resolved identity; only unattributed backend-level events use the aggregate installation consent.

## PR-Specific Documents

When working on a PR that requires design documents, live-test logs, development-only scripts, or other temporary artifacts that should **not** be merged to `main`, store them in a `.pr/` directory at the repository root.

```bash
mkdir -p .pr

.pr/
├── design.md       # Design decisions and architecture notes
├── analysis.md     # Investigation or debugging notes
└── notes.md        # Any other PR-specific content
```

The `PR Artifacts` workflow warns reviewers when `.pr/` exists on a PR and automatically removes the directory with a follow-up commit when a same-repo PR is approved. Fork PRs must remove `.pr/` manually before merge.

Important notes:

- Do not put anything in `.pr/` that needs to be preserved.
- The `.pr/` check is informational during development; it posts a notice rather than blocking the PR.
- For fork PRs, remove `.pr/` manually before merging.


## Dispatch Pipeline

The dispatcher uses a **fire-and-forget** model. For each PENDING run:

1. **Fetch per-user API key** — `get_api_key_for_automation_run()` mints a key via the service key
2. **Resolve tarball** — Internal (`oh-internal://`) downloads from GCS; external (HTTP) URLs are downloaded inside the sandbox
3. **Create sandbox** — `POST /api/v1/sandboxes` (Cloud API, Bearer token auth)
4. **Wait for RUNNING** — Poll `GET /api/v1/sandboxes?id=<id>` until status=RUNNING
5. **Upload/download tarball** — `POST /api/file/upload/<path>` (agent-server) or `curl` inside sandbox
6. **Start entrypoint** — `POST /api/bash/start_bash_command` (agent-server)
   - Extracts tarball, runs setup.sh (if present), exports env vars, runs entrypoint
7. **Return immediately** — Dispatcher does not wait for completion

Completion is handled asynchronously:
- **Happy path**: SDK inside sandbox POSTs to `POST /api/v1/automations/runs/{id}/complete`
- **Fallback**: Watchdog scans for runs past their `timeout_at` deadline, verifies status via sandbox bash history, and marks as COMPLETED or FAILED

### Env Vars Injected Into Sandbox

| Variable | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` | Per-user key issued via service key | SDK auth for get_llm()/get_secrets() |
| `OPENHANDS_CLOUD_API_URL` | Config (`openhands_api_base_url`) | Cloud API base URL |
| `SANDBOX_ID` | From sandbox creation response | SDK reads for settings API calls |
| `SESSION_API_KEY` | From sandbox creation response | SDK reads for settings API auth |
| `AUTOMATION_CALLBACK_URL` | Constructed by dispatcher | SDK posts completion status here |
| `AUTOMATION_RUN_ID` | Run ID | Included in callback payload |
| `AUTOMATION_EVENT_PAYLOAD` | Trigger context JSON | Available to user's script; preset scripts also use it to set a descriptive conversation title |
| `AUTOMATION_CONVERSATION_ID` | Derived by the service, `continue_conversation` runs only | The id the script must give its conversation, so a later event on the same subject reaches it. A custom script that ignores it gets a fresh conversation per event |

The SDK's `OpenHandsCloudWorkspace(local_agent_server_mode=True)` reads `SANDBOX_ID`, `SESSION_API_KEY`, and `AGENT_SERVER_PORT` from env vars automatically.

## Callback & Race Condition Handling

- **Callback auth**: The completion endpoint (`/runs/{id}/complete`) uses standard API key auth — the per-user `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` passed into the sandbox is validated via `authenticate_request`, and ownership is verified against the run's parent automation.
- **Optimistic locking**: Both callback endpoint and watchdog use `UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'RUNNING'` and check `CursorResult.rowcount` to handle races. Returns 409 on conflict.
- **Sandbox cleanup**: On callback, sandbox is deleted in a fire-and-forget background task (unless `keep_alive=True`). On dispatch failure, the dispatcher deletes the sandbox immediately.

## Database

Supports **PostgreSQL** (cloud) and **SQLite** (local/self-hosted).

| Feature | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Config | `AUTOMATION_DB_HOST`, `AUTOMATION_DB_PORT`, etc. | `AUTOMATION_DB_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///path.db` |
| Driver | asyncpg | aiosqlite |
| Row locking | `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` | Skipped (single-process) |
| Migrations | `alembic upgrade head` (manual) | Auto-run on startup |

### Writing Migrations

Migrations must be **cross-database compatible**:

```python
# ✅ DO: Import and use generic SQLAlchemy types
from sqlalchemy import Column, JSON, Uuid
Column("id", Uuid, primary_key=True)
Column("data", JSON, nullable=False)

# ❌ DON'T: Use PostgreSQL-specific types
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID, JSONB
Column("id", UUID(as_uuid=True), ...)  # Won't work on SQLite
Column("data", JSONB, ...)             # Won't work on SQLite
```

For PostgreSQL-only features (partial indexes, advisory locks), use conditionals:

```python
def _is_sqlite() -> bool:
    return op.get_bind().dialect.name == "sqlite"

def upgrade() -> None:
    # ... create tables ...
    if not _is_sqlite():
        op.create_index("ix_partial", "table", ["col"], postgresql_where=...)
```

- **Locking patterns**: `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in scheduler/dispatcher — check `using_sqlite()` to skip on SQLite

## Preset-Based Automation Creation

Presets are ready-to-use automation configurations where users provide arguments (like a prompt) instead of writing SDK scripts.

### Prompt Preset

The `/v1/preset/prompt` endpoint allows creating automations by simply providing a prompt, without manually creating and uploading a tarball.

#### How It Works

1. User sends `POST /v1/preset/prompt` with `name`, `prompt`, and `trigger`
2. Service generates SDK boilerplate code with the user's prompt
3. Creates a tarball containing:
   - `main.py` - SDK boilerplate that loads and executes the prompt
   - `prompt.txt` - The user's prompt text
   - `setup.sh` - SDK installation script
4. Uploads the tarball to storage (creates `TarballUpload` record)
5. Creates the `Automation` record referencing the internal upload

#### Files

- `openhands/automation/preset_router.py` - Endpoint and tarball generation logic
- `openhands/automation/presets/prompt/sdk_main.py` - SDK boilerplate that fetches LLM, secrets, and MCP config
- `openhands/automation/presets/prompt/setup.sh` - SDK installation script (installs from PyPI)

#### Request Schema

```json
{
  "name": "My Automation",
  "prompt": "Create a file called hello.txt with 'Hello World' inside",
  "trigger": {"type": "cron", "schedule": "0 9 * * 1", "timezone": "UTC"},
  "timeout": 300  // optional
}
```

### Notes

- The `presets/` directory is excluded from ruff and pyright linting since it contains SDK code that runs in the sandbox, not application code
- The generated tarball uses `python main.py` as the entrypoint and `setup.sh` as the setup script
- Future presets (e.g., plugins) can be added as additional subdirectories under `openhands/automation/presets/`

## Catalog Bundles

A catalog entry in `OpenHands/extensions` normally ships a prompt, created
through a preset endpoint. An entry whose automation is deterministic machinery
— polling, dedupe, state, fixed API calls — ships a **script tarball** instead,
which the host uploads (`POST /v1/uploads`) and creates from (`POST /v1`).

Execution is unchanged: a bundle run is an ordinary tarball run. What the raw
path gained is the catalog contract the presets already had:

- **`template` provenance** (`TemplateProvenance` in `schemas.py`), accepted by
  all three creation endpoints and stored under `preset_metadata["template"]`.
  `find_existing_template_automation` (`utils/templates.py`) is consulted first,
  so enabling an entry twice returns the existing automation with a 200.
  `record_first_run_outcome` keys on the same value, so bundles get first-run
  telemetry for free.
- **Preflight**: `POST /v1/validate` accepts `"endpoint": "/v1"`. It validates
  the body, not the upload — `tarball_path` ownership is checked at creation.
- **`customTarball`** in `GET /v1/capabilities` `features`, so an entry can
  require it and a client can tell whether a bundle card is runnable here.

`CreateAutomationRequest` has no `repos`, so a bundle cannot ask the service to
clone; it fetches what it needs itself.

## Git Sync

Local/self-hosted deployments can mirror their automations to a git repo for
visibility, versioning, and backup — see issue #300. **Only active in local
mode** (`AUTOMATION_AGENT_SERVER_URL` set): a single repo maps to a single
agent server, which doesn't make sense for the multi-tenant SaaS deployment.

- Configuring a repo is what enables sync — there is no separate feature
  flag. The repo URL may come either from `AUTOMATION_GIT_SYNC_REPO_URL` or
  from the Git Sync page, and nothing syncs until one is set. The background
  loop and the `dirty` CRUD hook start in every local-mode deployment
  (`is_git_sync_supported`), idle, so a repo configured from the UI syncs
  without a restart. See `GitSyncSettings` in
  `config.py` for the full list of env vars.
- Each automation is stored under `{git_sync_path}/{slug}/` as `automation.yaml`
  (metadata) plus its tarball contents extracted under `tarball/**`. Those are
  the only paths the exporter owns (`is_generated_path`): other files committed
  in the same directory are left alone. `automation.yaml` carries a
  `tarball_executables` list when any tarball member is executable, since the
  extracted files are committed as plain content and the mode would otherwise
  be lost on the way back in.
- `git_sync_path` is validated by `normalize_git_sync_path`: repo-relative, no
  `..`, no leading/trailing slashes, never empty. It is joined onto the local
  checkout and passed to `git add -- <path>`, and each slug directory under it
  is pruned during export, so a traversing value would delete host directories.
- `git_sync/router.py` exposes `GET /v1/git-sync/status`,
  `PUT /v1/git-sync/config`, `POST /v1/git-sync/sync` (manual trigger), and
  `POST /v1/git-sync/check`.
- `POST /v1/git-sync/check` takes the same body as `PUT /config` and reports
  whether *that* configuration can reach its repo, without saving it or
  syncing: `resolve_candidate_git_sync_settings` merges the update in memory,
  and `check_remote_access` runs a single `git ls-remote`. Keep it that way —
  validating by running a cycle would clone, import whatever the repo holds
  into the local automations, and push every dirty automation to a URL nobody
  has vetted yet, which for a mistyped URL is the damage rather than the
  diagnosis. It proves read access only: a token with no write scope passes
  and still fails at push time, and the encryption key is never exercised. A
  branch that doesn't exist yet is reported as `branch_exists: false`, not a
  failure — the first cycle creates it. A bad configuration comes back as
  `200 {"ok": false, "detail": ...}`, since the request itself succeeded.
- **Sync is manual by default**: the interval defaults to `0`, meaning a
  cycle runs only when `POST /v1/git-sync/sync` is called. Set a positive
  `interval_seconds` via `PUT /v1/git-sync/config` (the UI) to also sync
  automatically. Unlike every other git-sync setting it has **no environment
  variable** — it is runtime-only config, stored with the other overrides
  (see `DEFAULT_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` in `git_sync/config_override.py`).
  The background loop always runs so a newly-set interval takes effect
  without a restart; while the interval is 0 it idles without syncing.
  Either way one cycle is the same bidirectional pull → import → export →
  push; there's no way to run a single direction.
- Conflict policy: an automation is marked `dirty` (in `AutomationGitSyncState`)
  on every create/update/delete via the API; the sync loop treats a dirty
  automation as authoritative over a conflicting git-side change for the same
  cycle — the VM always wins until its change has been pushed. The import skips
  a dirty slug and the export then compares against what is actually on disk,
  not against `state.content_hash`: a git-side edit leaves the DB row untouched,
  so a hash comparison would skip the write and strand the two versions.
- Automations that predate git sync being switched on have no state row, and the
  export only reads dirty ones. `_backfill_missing_states` creates them (dirty)
  at the start of every cycle, so the first sync exports everything rather than
  reporting success against an empty repo.
- Automations created directly in git (e.g. via a PR) are imported and
  stamped with the deterministic local-mode user/org IDs from `auth.py`'s
  `_get_local_user()`.
- **Encryption**: set `AUTOMATION_GIT_SYNC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to encrypt file
  contents (via the SDK's Fernet-based `Cipher`, same primitive as the KV
  store) before they're committed. Reading a repo written before encryption
  was turned on still works — plaintext files pass through unchanged.
- **Runtime config**: `PUT /v1/git-sync/config` reconfigures or pauses/resumes
  an already-running sync (repo/branch/path/token/encryption key/author)
  without a restart, via `git_sync/config_override.py` (overrides stored as
  JSON in `automation_service_metadata`). Setting a repo URL there enables
  sync without a restart; only a deployment that can't sync at all (not local
  mode) is refused, on both the config endpoint (409) and the manual trigger
  (503).
- The token and encryption key in that blob are encrypted at rest by
  `git_sync/secret_store.py`, wrapped with `AUTOMATION_KV_SECRET` when the
  deployment sets one and otherwise with a key generated into a 0600 file
  under the workspace. If neither can be obtained, `PUT /config` fails with a
  503 rather than storing the secret in the clear.
- `GET /v1/git-sync/status` also reports `last_error`/`last_error_at` from
  the most recent failed cycle, cleared on the next successful one.
- **In-flight cycles**: a cycle writes its outcome only when it ends, so
  `/status` also reports `sync_in_progress`/`sync_started_at` — otherwise a
  caller can't tell a running sync from one that never started, and a cycle
  the periodic loop began is invisible to the UI. The flag is in-process
  state (`get_sync_started_at`), scoped like the `_sync_cycle_lock` it
  shadows: a crash mid-cycle can't strand it the way a persisted flag would.
  `POST /v1/git-sync/sync` returns `triggered: false` instead of scheduling
  when one is already running — that cycle covers everything the new one
  would, and the lock would only queue it behind anyway.

## Stream Sources

Events that arrive over a connection this service holds open instead of an
inbound HTTP request — today only Slack Socket Mode. Past `emit()` nothing is
special: the event goes through `accept_event()` like any webhook, so it
matches **unmodified automation definitions** and is deduplicated on the
provider's delivery id.

- **Configuring an app is the switch**: the supervisor starts when
  `AUTOMATION_SLACK_APPS` is non-empty, so a deployment that configures none is
  unchanged and there is no second var to flip. `AUTOMATION_STREAMS_ENABLED`
  defaults on and exists only as a kill switch. Self-hosted only: Slack does
  not allow Socket Mode apps in its public Marketplace, and a pinned connection
  does not fit a stateless autoscaled tier.
- **Configured from the environment**, not a table — `AUTOMATION_SLACK_APPS`,
  a JSON list of `{org_id, app_token, bot_token, team_id, bot_user_id}`. Per-org
  socket configuration is a multi-tenant requirement; taking it now would cost
  a migration and a credential-encryption surface first. See `StreamSettings`.
- **A provider owns its loop.** `run(emit, shutdown)` holds the connection and
  pushes events out; it is not polled, because `slack_sdk` already reconnects
  correctly and a `receive()` shape would reimplement that badly.
- **The supervisor catches per source**, restarting with exponential backoff,
  so one bad provider cannot take down the others or any other loop. A
  `StreamConfigError` is terminal — nothing a restart can fix.
- **Slack rules**: ack before any other work (unacked envelopes are
  redelivered), drop the bot's own messages (`bot_id`/`subtype`), check
  `team_id` on every envelope, and assert `team_id` *and* `bot_user_id` against
  `auth.test` before connecting, so a mis-pasted token fails loudly instead of
  bridging the wrong workspace.
- **Health** is process-local (`stream_health()`): `last_connected_at`,
  `last_event_at`, `consecutive_failures`. Nothing renders it yet.
- Slack distributes payloads across up to 10 connections per app, so this one
  provider is safe active-active — a Slack guarantee, not a general one, hence
  `Capabilities.tolerates_multiple_connections` in `providers.py`.

## Release Procedure

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
via the centralized reusable workflows in
[`OpenHands/release-actions`](https://github.com/OpenHands/release-actions). You do
**not** bump versions or push tags by hand — release-please does both from the
Conventional Commit history. (The old manual `Prepare Release` workflow has been
removed.)

### Day-to-day flow

1. Open a PR against `main` with a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
   title (`feat: …`, `fix: …`, `docs: …`, …). The `pr` workflow lints the title and
   applies a `type: <type>` label.
2. Squash-merge it. The **PR title becomes the commit message** release-please reads,
   so the repo is configured to squash-merge with `PR_TITLE` as the commit title.
3. On merge, release-please opens/updates a `chore(main): release X.Y.Z` PR that:
   - bumps the version everywhere it is embedded (see table below), derived from the
     merged commit types — `fix` → patch, `feat` → minor, breaking → major;
   - aggregates the GitHub release notes (grouped by `type:` label via
     `.github/release.yml`).
4. **Merging that release PR publishes the release**: it tags the commit (e.g. `1.1.0`,
   no `v` prefix) and publishes the GitHub release. The tag then triggers the publish
   workflows below, and shipped PRs are back-labeled `released: X.Y.Z`.

### Versions release-please keeps in sync

A single repo version is applied to every embedded location (configured in
`release-please-config.json`):

| File | How it is updated |
|------|-------------------|
| `pyproject.toml` (`[project].version`) | native `python` release-type |
| `uv.lock` (root package) | `toml` updater (`$.package[?(@.name.value=='openhands-automation')].version`) |
| `openhands/automation/__init__.py` (`__version__`) | `generic` updater (`# x-release-please-version`) |
| `openhands/automation/app.py` (FastAPI `version=`) | `generic` updater (`# x-release-please-version`) |

The lock file is bumped so the release PR's own CI (`uv sync --frozen`)
stays green. Keep the `# x-release-please-version` annotations on the `__init__.py`
and `app.py` version lines.

### What the release tag triggers

| Workflow | File | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| Publish PyPI Package | `pypi-release.yml` | Builds and publishes `openhands-automation` to PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing |
| Tag Docker images | `tag-image.yml` | Aliases the existing `sha-<commit>` GHCR image to the release tag plus `X.Y` / `X` / `latest` (the `ghcr-build.yml` build for that commit must have run first) |

> Prerequisites (one-time, org/repo settings — not in this repo): the org secrets
> `RELEASE_APP_ID` / `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (the GitHub App release-please uses —
> required so the release tag triggers the publish workflows above), and squash-merge
> configured with `PR_TITLE` as the commit title.

### SDK dependency bumps

When bumping `openhands-sdk` / `openhands-workspace` pins:
1. Update both versions in `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
2. Run `uv lock` to regenerate `uv.lock`.
3. Open a Conventional Commit PR (e.g. `fix: bump SDK to <ver>`) and squash-merge it —
   release-please handles the version bump and release.
4. After the release publishes, update `AUTOMATION_SHA` in the deploy repo:
   - `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`
   - `.github/workflows/deploy-automation.yaml`
