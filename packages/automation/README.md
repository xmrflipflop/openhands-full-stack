# OpenHands Automation Service

> ⚠️ **Beta**: This project is currently in beta. APIs and features may change without notice.

Scheduled and event-driven automation execution for OpenHands Cloud. This service allows users to create automations that run on a schedule (cron) or in response to events (webhooks).

## Features

- **Scheduled Automations**: Run OpenHands conversations on a cron schedule
- **Event-Driven**: Trigger automations via webhooks (e.g., GitHub events)
- **API Key Management**: Per-user API keys for secure automation access
- **Run History**: Track automation runs with status and results

## Repository boundaries

The Automation Service owns automation definitions, cron scheduling, webhooks, run history, dispatch, and sandbox lifecycle orchestration. It manages when work runs; the Agent Server and [`OpenHands/software-agent-sdk`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk) execute the agent conversations and own agent/tool behavior, workspaces, events, and API endpoints.

[`OpenHands/typescript-client`](https://github.com/OpenHands/typescript-client) provides typed browser access to the Agent Server API, while [`OpenHands/OpenHands`](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands) owns Agent Canvas UI and frontend integration. If a change belongs in one of those repositories, open the PR there rather than duplicating the logic here.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- PostgreSQL (or use testcontainers for testing)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Run the service locally (requires PostgreSQL)
uv run uvicorn openhands.automation.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=openhands/automation --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Format code
uv run ruff format

# Lint code
uv run ruff check --fix

# Type check
uv run pyright
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Apply migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

## Docker
