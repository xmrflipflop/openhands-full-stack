"""Add key-value store for automation state persistence.

This migration adds the ``automation_kv`` table — one row per automation
holding the entire state document as an encrypted blob.

Single-Document Design (Deadlock Prevention)
============================================

Each automation has exactly ONE row in automation_kv containing its entire
state as an encrypted JSON document. The API presents a key-value interface,
but "keys" are top-level fields within this single document.

By storing all state in one row per automation, we eliminate multi-key
deadlock scenarios. All operations serialize through a single row lock.

Storage Design
==============

The encrypted state is stored as TEXT (a Fernet token, URL-safe base64).
We use the SDK's ``openhands.sdk.utils.cipher.Cipher`` (Fernet under the
hood) for encryption — see ``openhands/automation/utils/kv.py``. Fernet
emits a base64 string rather than raw bytes, so TEXT is the natural column
type. The ~33% base64 overhead is acceptable for the small JSON documents
typical of automation state (counters, cursors, configs) and keeps the
schema simple.
