"""
Event schema module for webhook event processing.

This module provides:
1. `WebhookEvent` base class for typed event payloads
2. `parse_event()` function to parse payloads from any source

Each source (GitHub, Linear, etc.) has its own WebhookEvent subclass.
Unknown sources automatically get `CustomWebhookEvent`.

Note: Filtering is handled by the trigger_matcher module using JMESPath
expressions against the raw payload. The event schemas are for validation
and providing typed access to payload fields.
