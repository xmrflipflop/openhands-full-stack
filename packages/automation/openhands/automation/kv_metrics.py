"""Prometheus metrics for KV store operations.

Provides observability into KV store performance and health:
- Operation latency by type
- Lock wait time
- Conflict (409) rate
- Version mismatch rate
- State document size

Label Design:
- We use 'automation_name' instead of 'automation_id' to reduce cardinality.
- If name is unavailable, we use a truncated hash of the automation_id.
- This keeps the metric time series manageable at scale.

Usage:
    from openhands.automation.kv_metrics import (
        kv_operation_duration,
        kv_conflict_total,
        record_operation,
    )

    # Record operation duration
    with record_operation("set", automation_id):
        await do_operation()

    # Or manually:
    with kv_operation_duration.labels(operation="get", automation="my-auto").time():
        await do_operation()
