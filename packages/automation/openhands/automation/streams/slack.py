"""Slack Socket Mode as a stream source.

Slack holds the connection open and pushes envelopes down it, so there is no
inbound request to authenticate: the app token is the credential, and the four
rules below are what keep the stream honest. Because `emit()` is an in-process
call there is no forwarding hop that can fail after the envelope is acked,
which is the failure an out-of-process bridge cannot avoid.
