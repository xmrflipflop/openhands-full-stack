"""Supervises one task per stream source for the life of the process.

A source holds a connection open for the life of the process, in the same
process as everything else. The supervisor is what keeps that from mattering:
every source is a child task whose exceptions are caught here, so one bad
provider can never take down the others, the scheduler, the dispatcher, or
HTTP webhook handling.
