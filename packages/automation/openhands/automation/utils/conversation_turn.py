"""Sending another turn to a conversation the agent server already holds.

`run` appends the message and, when true, starts the loop if it is not already
running. A trigger can set it false to leave the turn unanswered, making the
conversation an ordered, durable buffer the script drains on its own terms.
Every failure returns False so the caller starts a run instead -- a reaped
sandbox is ordinary, not an error.

A continue does not run the automation's script, so `compose_turn` is the only
thing the agent sees of the event. It renders the message a human actually
wrote; the verbatim payload is the last resort, not the default.
