# Release Automation Workflows

This document describes the automated release workflows for the OpenHands Software Agent SDK.

## Overview

The release process has been automated with three GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **prepare-release.yml** - Prepares a release PR with version updates
2. **pypi-release.yml** - Automatically publishes packages to PyPI when a release is created
3. **release-binaries.yml** - Builds and smoke-tests multi-arch agent-server binaries
   on releases and main pushes; release runs also attach binaries to the release

## How to Create a New Release

### Step 1: Trigger the Prepare Release Workflow

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/actions)
2. Select **"Prepare Release"** workflow from the left sidebar
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Enter the version number (e.g., `1.2.3`) - must be in format `X.Y.Z`
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

The workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Create a new branch named `rel-X.Y.Z`
- ✅ Update all package versions using `make set-package-version`
- ✅ Commit the changes
- ✅ Push the branch
- ✅ Create a PR with labels `integration-tests` and `test-examples`

### Step 2: Review the PR

The created PR will include a checklist. Complete the following:

- [ ] Fix any deprecation deadlines if they exist
- [ ] Verify integration tests pass (triggered by `integration-tests` label)
- [ ] Verify example checks pass (triggered by `test-examples` label)
- [ ] Confirm any merged `release-note-required` PRs are accurately called out in the final release notes
- [ ] Review and approve the PR

### Step 3: Create the GitHub Release

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/releases/new)
2. Click **"Draft a new release"**
3. Configure the release:
   - **Tag**: `vX.Y.Z` (must match the version)
   - **Branch**: `rel-X.Y.Z` (the branch created by the workflow)
   - **Previous tag**: Select the previous release version
4. Click **"Generate release notes"** to auto-generate the changelog
5. Review and edit the release notes as needed
6. Click **"Publish release"**

### Step 4: PyPI Publication (Automated)

Once the release is published, the **pypi-release.yml** workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Build all packages (openhands-sdk, openhands-tools, openhands-workspace, openhands-agent-server)
- ✅ Publish them to PyPI

You can monitor the progress in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/actions/workflows/pypi-release.yml).

### Step 4b: Release Binaries + Docker Smoke Test (Automated)

In parallel with the PyPI workflow, **release-binaries.yml** also fires on `release: published`.
It also runs on every push to `main` as ongoing smoke coverage. It:

- ✅ Builds the agent-server PyInstaller binary on a 5-runner matrix
  (linux x86_64/arm64, macOS x86_64/arm64, windows x86_64) and smoke-tests each
- ✅ Generates a combined `SHA256SUMS` and attaches all artifacts to the GitHub
  release as `agent-server-<version>-<os>-<arch>` on release/manual runs
- ✅ Verifies that the multi-arch Docker manifest
  `ghcr.io/openhands/agent-server:<image-tag>-<variant>` published by
  `server.yml` covers both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` for every variant
  (`python`, `java`, `golang`)
- ✅ Pulls each variant on each architecture with `--platform=linux/<arch>`,
  boots the container, and asserts `/health` responds

On `push` events, `<image-tag>` is the 7-character commit SHA and binaries
remain as workflow artifacts only. On release/manual runs, `<image-tag>` is the
release version and the binaries are uploaded to the GitHub release.

#### Build time / runner expectations

| Stage | Runtime (typical) | Runners |
|---|---|---|
| Binary builds (5-way matrix, parallel) | ~10–15 min on Linux, ~12–18 min on macOS | `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, `macos-15-intel`, `macos-14`, `windows-2022` |
| `publish-binaries` (download + checksum + upload) | ~1–2 min | `ubuntu-24.04` |
| `docker-smoke-test` (6-way matrix, parallel) | Up to 45 min (mostly polling for the docker images) | `ubuntu-24.04` for amd64, `ubuntu-24.04-arm` for arm64 |

#### QEMU / buildx requirements

The smoke test does **not** require QEMU: each (variant, arch) job runs on a
runner whose architecture matches `--platform=linux/<arch>`, so containers run
natively. We do still set up Docker Buildx so we can call
`docker buildx imagetools inspect` on the multi-arch manifest list.

The wait window for the multi-arch manifest is 45 min — long enough to absorb
the full `server.yml` matrix runtime (~25–30 min for `build-and-push-image` +
`merge-manifests`) when this workflow races the corresponding `server.yml` run
for a release tag or main-branch push.

If the matching manifest is already in GHCR, the wait step exits immediately.

### Step 5: Version Bump PRs (Automated)

After successful PyPI publication, the workflow will automatically create PRs to update SDK versions in downstream repositories:

- **[OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands)** - Updates `openhands-sdk`, `openhands-tools`, and `openhands-agent-server` versions
- **[OpenHands-CLI](https://github.com/OpenHands/openhands-cli)** - Updates `openhands-sdk` and `openhands-tools` versions
- **[automation](https://github.com/OpenHands/automation)** - Updates `openhands-sdk` and `openhands-workspace` versions. Opened with a `fix:` title so the repo's release-please cuts a patch release, publishing an `openhands-automation` build pinned to this SDK (which the agent-canvas `sdk-version-sync` check requires).
- **[typescript-client](https://github.com/OpenHands/typescript-client)** - Updates the pinned `agent-server` image tag (`config.agentServerImage`); runs as a separate job that waits on the GHCR image rather than PyPI.

These PRs will:
- Be created automatically with branch name `bump-sdk-X.Y.Z` (`bump-agent-server-X.Y.Z` for typescript-client)
- Include links back to the SDK release
- Need to be reviewed and merged by the respective repository maintainers

### Step 6: Post-Release Tasks

- [ ] Merge the release PR to main
- [ ] Review and merge the auto-created version bump PRs in OpenHands, OpenHands-CLI, automation, and typescript-client (merging the automation PR triggers its release-please release PR; merge that too to publish the pinned `openhands-automation`)
- [ ] Run evaluation on OpenHands Index (manual step)
- [ ] Announce the release

## Manual PyPI Release (If Needed)

If you need to manually trigger the PyPI release workflow:

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/actions)
2. Select **"Publish all OpenHands packages (uv)"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Select the branch/tag you want to publish from
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

## Workflow Files

- `.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml` - Automated release preparation
- `.github/workflows/pypi-release.yml` - PyPI package publication
- `.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml` - Multi-arch binary publishing and
  docker manifest smoke test on releases and main pushes

## Troubleshooting

### Version Format Error

If you get a version format error, ensure you're using the format `X.Y.Z` (e.g., `1.2.3`), not `vX.Y.Z`.

### PR Creation Failed

If the PR creation fails, check:
- The branch doesn't already exist
- You have proper permissions
- The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has sufficient permissions

### PyPI Publication Failed

If PyPI publication fails:
- Check that the `PYPI_TOKEN_OPENHANDS` secret is properly configured
- Verify the version doesn't already exist on PyPI
- Check the workflow logs for specific error messages

### Release Binaries Failed

If `release-binaries.yml` fails:
- **Binary build failure**: re-run the failed matrix job; PyInstaller flakes are
  rare but possible. If it persists, the issue is likely in `agent-server.spec`.
- **`docker-smoke-test` timed out waiting for the manifest**: `server.yml` did
  not publish multi-arch images for the matching release tag or commit SHA.
  Check that workflow's corresponding run and re-trigger if needed.
- **`/health` never responded**: open the failing job; the cleanup trap dumps
  the last 100 lines of `docker logs` for the container.
- Release/manual runs can be re-run against an existing tag via
  `workflow_dispatch` with the `release_tag` input (e.g. `v1.20.1`);
  `gh release upload --clobber` makes this safe.

## Previous Manual Process

For reference, the previous manual release checklist was:

- [ ] Checkout SDK repo, use `make set-package-version version=x.x.x` to set the version
- [ ] Push to a branch like `rel-x.x.x` and start a PR
- [ ] Fix any "deprecation deadlines" if they exist
- [ ] Tag "integration-tests" and make sure integration test all pass
- [ ] Tag "test-examples" and make sure example checks all pass
- [ ] Draft a new release
- [ ] Use workflow to publish to PyPI on tag `v1.X.X`
- [ ] Evaluation on OpenHands Index

Most of these steps are now automated!
